## About

The purpose of this repository is to provide practical implementations of fundamental and advanced data structures. By showcasing them in C++, Python, and JavaScript, this repository serves as a valuable resource for developers looking to understand data structures across different languages and apply them in real-world applications.

## Data Structures Covered

Here are some of the data structures that will be included in this repository:

- **Basic Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- **Trees**: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, Trie
- **Graphs**: Graph Representations, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, etc.
- **Hashing**: Hash Tables, Hash Maps
- **Heaps**: Min-Heap, Max-Heap, Priority Queue
- **Others**: Disjoint Sets, Bloom Filters, Segment Trees, etc.

## Languages

This repository provides implementations in:

- **C++**: Known for its speed and system-level access, C++ provides efficient and optimized data structures.
- **Python**: With its clear syntax and readability, Python is ideal for illustrating the logic of each data structure.
- **JavaScript**: As a popular language for web development, JavaScript implementations are suitable for understanding data structures in front-end and back-end web applications.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures.git
cd data-structures
```

## Usage

Each data structure is organized by type and language in separate folders. For example:

```plaintext
data-structures/
├── C++/
│   ├── linked-list/
│   ├── stack/
│   └── queue/
├── Python/
│   ├── linked-list/
│   ├── stack/
│   └── queue/
└── JavaScript/
    ├── linked-list/
    ├── stack/
    └── queue/
```

Navigate to the folder for the language and data structure you want to explore. Each folder contains a README file describing the specifics of the implementation and examples of usage.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you’d like to improve an existing implementation, add new data structures, or suggest enhancements, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
